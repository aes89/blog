### Purpose
This project was created as part of a 2.5 day Hackathon through Coder Academy. The aim of the Hackathon was to create an app including both a front end and a back end using Express JS. On the server-side is was required to have express and mongo server than responds to requests with data, and on the client side it was required to have HTML/CSS/JavaScript that sent requests, received and displayed data from the server. We were also required to use Git Workflows.
